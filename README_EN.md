# ElysiumLogin
ElysiumLogin is a plugin for the server login system launched by the Skillfully Studio, a subsidiary of Elysium.

Please see the description below:
```
We are developing a plugin called "ElysiumLogin," just as its name suggests, 
this is a plugin for player login. However, what sets it apart is that it is a more feature-rich, 
-> customized plugin aimed at the web end. 
Functionally, it has the essential login capabilities that a regular login plugin would have, but it
-> has removed the registration and password reset functions, instead implementing these features on the web end.
Additionally, it has a decentralized-like feature for group servers, meaning that if there is a data
-> change in one server, the other servers will automatically update their local data.
On this basis, it can provide a high degree of customizable configuration.
If you have valuable suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
